Recommendation System

1.
Problem Definition
- The context - Why is this problem important to solve?
- The objectives - What is the intended goal?
- The key questions - What are the key questions that need to be answered?
- The problem formulation - What is it that we are trying to solve using data science?
Data Exploration
- Data Description - What is the background of this data? What does it contain?
- Observations & Insights - What are some key patterns in the data? What does it mean for the problem formulation? Are there any data treatments or pre-processing required?
Proposed approach
- Potential techniques - What different techniques should be explored?
- Overall solution design - What is the potential solution design?
- Measures of success - What are the key measures of success to compare potential techniques?

2.
- Refined insights - What are the most meaningful insights from the data relevant to the problem?
- Comparison of various techniques and their relative performance - How do different techniques perform? Which one is performing relatively better? Is there scope to improve the performance further?
- Proposal for the final solution design - What model do you propose to be adopted? Why is this the best solution to adopt?

3.
- Executive Summary - What are the key takeaways? What are the key next steps?
- Problem and solution summary - What problem was being solved? What are the key points that describe the final proposed solution design? Why is this a 'valid' solution that is likely to solve the problem?
- Recommendations for implementation - What are some key recommendations to implement the solutions? What are the key actionable for stakeholders? What is the expected benefit and/or costs? What are the key risks and challenges? What further analysis needs to be done or what other associated problems need to be solved?
